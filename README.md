# Rover.com Data Science Take-Home Assignment

I use this an an example for my data science students so that they are exposed to a real take-home assessment before their job search begins. To ensure proper formatting and for the interactive charts to work properly I recommend viewing my solution through the [nbviewer link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Booleans/rover-analytics-assessment/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) instead of GitHub.

## Scenario

In this exercise, imagine that Rover has acquired a small pet care start-up. As an analyst, you have been tasked with the responsibility of exploring their database.

## Submission Requirements
For sections II-VI, choose the top 3 sections that interest you and submit your
work for those.
Keep any information that could identify you (e.g., photos, your name) in a
separate folder named PII or a separate file named pii.txt so that we can
anonymize your work.

## Exercises

### I. Exploring the Database
We begin by asking a few basic questions about the users of this platform. This first exercise is presented with answers so that you can diagnose any issues you might have connecting to or working with the data.
1. How many users have signed up?
> The answer is 64393.
2. How many users signed up prior to 2018-02-03 ?
> The answer is 35826.
3. What percentage of users have added pets?
> The answer is 80.43%.
4. Of those users, how many pets have they added on average?
> The answer is 1.501.
5. What percentage of pets play well with cats?
> The answer is 24.85%.

### II. Conversations and Bookings
Some users can offer pet care services. When an owner needs pet care, they can
create a conversation with another user that offers the service they are interested in.
After exchanging some messages and possibly meeting in person, that conversation
hopefully books. In that case, services are paid for and delivered. Occasionally, some
conversations that have booked may be cancelled. Lastly, for uncancelled bookings,
both owners and sitters have the option of leaving a review. In the following
questions, we explore these concepts.
1. For uncancelled bookings, is the owner or provider more likely to leave a review
and which tends to leave better reviews? How would you narrate this finding to a
business partner?

### III. Recent Daily Booking Rate
The snapshot of this database was taken on `2018-08-02` at midnight and only
contains data reflecting events prior to that date. A junior analyst is investigating
daily booking rate during the days prior to the snapshot and is concerned about an
apparent downward trend. You are tasked with helping them out.
1. First, let's reproduce their results. They tell you that daily booking rate is defined
to be the percentage of conversations created each day that eventually book.
What is the daily booking rate for each of the 90 days prior to the snapshot? Is
there a downward trend?
2. Can you narrate a reason why this trend exists? Is there a reason to be
concerned? Please provide additional data and evidence to justify your position.

### IV. Analyzing Take Rate
In order to do the next exercise, you will need to understand the fee structure for this
company. Each user has a fee associated with their account (recorded on
people_person ). If that user books as an owner, the company charges a service fee
(in addition to the booking total) that is a percentage of the booking total (to a
maximum of $50). Also, each service has a fee amount (recorded on
`services_service`). Before a provider receives their payment, the company takes a
percentage of the booking total as dictated by that fee. As an example, suppose an
owner has a fee amount of 5% and books with a service that has a fee amount of
15%. If the booking was for $100, then the owner would get charged $105 (adding
the owner ºs fee). The $5 owner fee would go to the company. An additional $15
would also go to the company since the service had a 15% fee associated to it. The
remaining $85 would go to the provider. To summarize:

|                  | Amount | Description                     |
|------------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Booking Total    | $100   | e.g., 4 walks at $25/walk       |
| Owner Fee        | $5     | 5% of the booking total         |
| Gross Billings   | $105   | charged to the owner            |
| Service Fee      | $15    | 15% of the booking total        |
| Net Revenue      | $20    | all fees that go to the company |
| Provider Payment | $85    | earnings for the provider       |

1. In each month, what were the gross billings and net revenue?
2. Define take rate to be the percentage of gross billings that is net revenue. In the
previous example, the take rate is slightly more than 19% since $20/$105 is
approximately 0.1905. In each month, what was the aggregate take rate?
3. Did take rate trend up or trend down or remain unchanged over time?
4. If it did change, investigate why and provide an explanation. Be sure to provide
additional data/charts/evidence that justify your explaination. Any claims should
be backed by data.

### V. New Conversation Flow
Internal documents indicate that this recently acquired company was performing
many A/B tests; we would like to investigate one. This platform had a conversation
page where owners and service providers could exchange messages as they
organized their booking. The team thought this page could use a re-design and set
out to improve its UI. A product manager then set up a test to measure the new
page's effectiveness. On `2018-04-04` , an A/B test was launched. For those owners
who sent a request, they would be randomly assigned to *variant* or *holdout* groups.
Those users who are in the variant group would see the new conversation flow.
However, those in the *holdout* group would see the old conversation flow. Providers
would always see the old conversation flow.
1. Did conversations with the new conversation page book at a higher rate?
2. Is it statistically significant?
3. Do you have any reservations about the experiment design? What would you
recommend as next steps?

# VI. Search Engine Marketing

Search engine advertising is a huge driver of new user accounts. Users that are
aquired through search engine marketing can be identified by looking at
`people_person.channel`. These users will have `'Google'` listed there. Historically,
this company spent an average of $30 per account to advertise in the 2nd position
on Google. However, on `2018-05-04`, they decided to start bidding for the 1st
position. Since `2018-05-04`, they have spent `$207180` in total.

1. For each day, determine the count of users that joined and were acquired
through Google. Plot this and confirm there is an inflection point on or near
`2018-05-04`.
2. How many users were acquired via Google advertising since `2018-05-04` and
what was the average cost per account?
3. Estimate how many users would have been acquired had the company not
changed its bidding strategy. What would have been the marketing spend in that
case?
4. How many additional accounts where created? What was the marginal cost per
account for these additional accounts?
